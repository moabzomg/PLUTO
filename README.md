# Computational Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics

I completed two big projects in my final year of undergraduate degree and the year of graduate degree, with the PLUTO code, freely-distributed software for computational physics, mainly in astrophysical fluid dynamics with Newtonian, relativistic or magnetic effects based on a system of conservation laws, using finite difference methods for time evolution. Please refer to their [official website](https://plutocode.ph.unito.it/) and the [documentation](https://plutocode.ph.unito.it/userguide.pdf) for details. I put their code with the version [4.4-patch3 (September 2024)](https://plutocode.ph.unito.it/Downloads/pluto-4.4-patch3.tar.gz) here for convenience.

I used PLUTO code to simulate 4 problems: the infinite long 1D propagating sound wave, the Sod Shock tube problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability due to velocity shear, and Rossby Wave instability in an accretion disk. 

# Simulation

To run the PLUTO code, a C complier such as `gcc`, GNU make and python is required.

1. Set the environment variable for convenience: `export PLUTO_DIR=/home/user/PLUTO`1

2. Download `main.c`, `definitions.h`, `pluto.ini`, `init.c`, `pluto.h` and put them in your working directory
